##OSINT- Easy


Like a good college student, Buckeye Billy has a great affinity for puzzles, eating right and traveling.
In a very college-student-like move, he is often found multitasking. He forgot to tell his roommates where he was off to.
Luckily, they found this picture, but it makes no sense. 
Can you help us find him?
