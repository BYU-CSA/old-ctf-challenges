# Monuments and Memes. -Medium
While I was in DC for the summer, I had the chance to visit a *lot* of monuments and memorials. 
During my sight-seeing, I came across a peculiar sight- a meme within a monument! Who would have thought people 80 years ago had a sense of humor. Anywho, the meme takes form in a phrase of three words. Can you find the meme and monument?
