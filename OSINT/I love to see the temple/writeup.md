# I love to see the temple - Easy
With general conference coming up, one of Ian's favorite parts is when the new temples are announced. 
This temple was announced before he was born, but was dedicated when he was a baby. Can you identify it? 
Careful, you only get one guess! Make sure you are 110% sure of your guess.

In the early 2000's President Hinckley announced and built several dozen small temples that all look very similar to each other. Running the image through reverse image search and checking Google Maps will eventually lead you to the right temple (the provided image is just a screenshot from Google Maps)
