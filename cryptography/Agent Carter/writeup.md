# Agent Peggy Carter

## Give the competitors this poem in a text file:
```
Agent Peggy Carter, skilled and bold,
Could outwit any foe, young or old.
Daring and resourceful, with nerves of steel,
Even the toughest challenges she'd reveal.

From the frontlines of war to the halls of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
Gallant and unflinching, her work never yields.
Heroic and determined, she'd never back down,
In the face of danger, she'd wear her crown.

Juggling espionage and secret ops with ease,
Keenly observing, she could always appease.
Loyal to her country, her friends, and her cause,
Making the hard choices, she never had any flaws.

Never afraid to speak her mind and take charge,
On missions impossible, she'd always lead the charge.
Proudly carrying the legacy of the Carter name,
Quick-witted and clever, she'd always aim for fame.

Respected by all, feared by her foes,
She'd leave them stunned, with nowhere to go.
Tenacious and brave, she'd always come through,
Understanding the stakes, she'd never misconstrue.

Victorious in battles, she'd always emerge,
With X-ray vision, she could detect any surge.
Yearning for justice and the truth to unfold,
Zealous in her pursuit, her story remains untold.
