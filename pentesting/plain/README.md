# Plain
Level: Easy

Description:
```
**READ THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THOROUGHLY BEFORE ATTEMPTING**

Our system administrator is pretty bad at his job and doesn't have a great password. See if you can break into his machine!

The flag will be located in `/root`

`ssh byuctf.xyz -p 40014`

**Rules of Engagement**:
- The *only* asset within scope of this challenge is the domain `byuctf.xyz` on port 40014. Note that *.ctfd.io and *.byu.edu are NOT in scope. Do not attempt to compromise any other servers or break into or scan any other ports for this challenge.
- Automated scanning tools *are* allowed for this challenge.
- Since the goal is to gain root access, the bug bounty program (details [here](https://byu.ctfd.io/ctf-bug-bounty)) does *not* apply. In addition, we understand that participants may have the ability to break the challenge for other participants since they will have full sudo access. We ask that you **avoid** this behavior to not ruin the learning experience for everyone. 
- If we find out you have intentionally broken the challenge to prevent others from getting a flag, you will be immediately banned from the competition and removed from the scoreboard - no questions asked.
- If you break something, change a configuration, remove a service, or believe this has happened (intentionally or otherwise) on the part of someone else, please reach out to Justin Applegate on Slack or at justink.applegate@gmail.com with screenshots and details. 
- This challenge runs in a Docker container. To ensure that the challenge's integrity is somewhat constant, we will be rebooting this container at the beginning of each hour (ie 5:00pm on the dot, 6:00pm on the dot, etc.). If you are suddenly kicked out for an unknown reason, this is likely why.
- If you are unsure about ANYTHING, ask Justin!
```

## Writeup
Brute forcing the username and password will reveal that the creds `administrator:password` work. This account has full sudo access, so running `sudo -i` should work. 

**Flag** - `byuctf{@lw@ys_ch@ng3_d3f@ult_cr3ds}`

## Hosting
This challenge should be a Docker container that runs an Ubuntu instance that can be accessed through SSH on port 40014. All the proper files are included in here. The command to build the docker container is (when located inside of this directory):

```bash
sudo docker build -t plain .
```

The command to start the challenge is:

```bash
sudo docker run -p 40014:22 --detach --name plain plain:latest
```

The command to stop the challenge (since CTRL+C won't work) is:

```bash
sudo docker stop plain
```

To have the challenge reboot every hour, run `crontab -e` as root and insert the line `0 * * * * /path/to/reboot_plain.sh`.
