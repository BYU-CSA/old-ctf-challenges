# Awkward
Level: Hard

Description:
```
*READ THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THOROUGHLY BEFORE ATTEMPTING**

Ian totally locked us out of one of our servers running critical services, that's awkward. See if you can break back in and escalate to root!

The flag will be located in `/root`

`11.22.33.44`

**Rules of Engagement**:
- The *only* asset within scope of this challenge is the IP address `11.22.33.44`. Note that *.ctfd.io, *.byu.edu, and *.byuctf.xyz are NOT in scope. Do not attempt to compromise any other servers or break into or scan any other ports for this challenge.
- Automated scanning tools *are* allowed for this challenge.
- Since the goal is to gain root access, the bug bounty program (details [here](https://byu.ctfd.io/ctf-bug-bounty)) does *not* apply. In addition, we understand that participants may have the ability to break the challenge for other participants since they will have full sudo access. We ask that you **avoid** this behavior to not ruin the learning experience for everyone. 
- If we find out you have intentionally broken the challenge to prevent others from getting a flag, you will be immediately banned from the competition and removed from the scoreboard - no questions asked.
- If you break something, change a configuration, remove a service, or believe this has happened (intentionally or otherwise) on the part of someone else, please reach out to Justin Applegate on Slack or at justink.applegate@gmail.com with screenshots and details. 
- If you are unsure about ANYTHING, ask Justin!

## Writeup
Port scan will reveal that 21 and 22 are open. FTP on port 21 allows anonymous access. One of the files contains the username and password hash for a user - `ftpuser`. A quick lookup reveals the hash is `letsgodude`. If you SSH with that username and password, you are granted access. Running `sudo -l` reveals that the user can use `awk` as root user, and using the suggested command in GTFOBins allows you a root shell. 

**Flag** - `byuctf{pls_d1s@bl3_an0nym0us_ftp}`
