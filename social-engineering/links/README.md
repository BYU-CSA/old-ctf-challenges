# Links
Level: Easy

Description:
```

```

## Writeup
The point of this challenge is that people will see the link going to justinapplegate.me and immediately click on it. They'll get Rick rolled because the link actually takes them to YouTube. Upon closer inspection (mouse hovering over the link), you can identify the hidden link. If you copy the URL displayed (not the one linked), it'll bring you to the page with the flag on it.

**Flag:** `ctf{always_check_where_links_go_before_clicking_them}`

## Real-World Application
This is meant to teach participants to never trust links simply because they look legit. You should always inspect them first or, even better, type it in the address bar yourself!
