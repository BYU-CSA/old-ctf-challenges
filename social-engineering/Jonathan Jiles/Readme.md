Question 1: In which you meet Johnny.
    A friend of a friend has this weird cousin whos obsessed with pigeons. Like I mean OBSESSED. Jonathan J Jiles is his name, and government drones are his game. I recently raised two pigeon babies over the summer and sent johnny a picture since he really likes them. Here's the picture, see what other pigeons Johnny has discovered...

    D&C 88:118 
    Lamentations 3:52
    Johnny likes his opinions. And the bee movie aparently. In the previous question, he also left a hint as to his favorite pidgeon book.

Question 3: In which Johnny gets Creative.
    Jonathan is quite the creative guy believe it or not. Lately with all the birds heading south for winter, he has taken up a few creative outlets to pass the time. He recently felt inspired by his greatest idol, to take a great song and make it his own. Can you find it?
