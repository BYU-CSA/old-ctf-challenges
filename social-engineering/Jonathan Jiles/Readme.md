## Jonathan OSINT Challenges

# Question 1: In which you meet Johnny. 
    A friend of a friend has this weird cousin whos obsessed with pigeons. 
    Like I mean OBSESSED. Jonathan J Jiles is his name, and government drones are his game. 
    I recently raised two pigeon babies over the summer and sent johnny a picture since he really likes them.
    Here's the picture, it seems like it almost went viral on his blog and other places... 
    See what other pigeons Johnny has discovered... One of five challenges in the series!

# Question 2: In which Johnny Shares his feelings
    D&C 88:118 
    Lamentations 3:52
    Johnny likes his opinions. 
    And the bee movie apparently.
    In the previous question, he also left a hint as to his favorite pidgeon book.
    One might say it is a *good read*.

# Question 3: In which Johnny gets Creative.
    Jonathan is quite the creative guy believe it or not. 
    Lately with all the birds heading south for winter, he has taken up a few creative outlets to pass the time.
    He recently felt inspired by his greatest idol, to take a great song and make it his own. 
    Can you find it?
