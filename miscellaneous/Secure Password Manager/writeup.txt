Challenge Intro: 

I am so confident in 1337 hacker abilities that I am going to give you the usernames and passwords to this file! Have fun figuring out how to open it! 
tip--I would only download the software from the vendor: "http://www.securekit.net/", I would not trust third party people on the internet for this... 

username is byuctf
password is byuctf

If you go to the wayback machine with the following information, you will find a download for the Secure Password Manager. If you enter the credentials, there will 
be a password stored that contains the flag.
