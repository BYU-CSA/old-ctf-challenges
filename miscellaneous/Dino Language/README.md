Description:
I found this file on the internet. Apparently it's evidence of a real dinosaur roaring in its native tongue. Check it out.

Flag:

Solution:

At about 25:35 the flag is spelled out verbally. This can be seen potentially in any spectogram analyzer as the wavelength changes here and nowhere else. The rest of the file is just a roar repeated the exact same way.
