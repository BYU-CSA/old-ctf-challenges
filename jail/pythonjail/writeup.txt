Dino Python Jail:

Solution: 
When the python script is ran, you are presented with a beautiful dino. You will also notice that there is some text presented... But it is all backwards. It says that all you need to do is print the flag (print flag) but we have gone back to the age of dinosaurs so the input needs to be in binary. 
in order to get the flag, the input needs to be in binary. In addidtion to that, the text needs to be reversed. I did this in a python script, I am sure there are tools online as well. 
so if you reverse your input "print flag" = "galf tnirp", and convert it to binary, either of the following payloads will result in the flag: 
"01100111011000010110110001100110001000000111010001101110011010010111001001110000"
"01100111 01100001 01101100 01100110 00100000 01110100 01101110 01101001 01110010 01110000"

FLAG: "{3m1t_0n1d_n1_kc4b_sl14j}ftcuyb"
