 Fursona Tester [You need a more creative name for this.]
Ardeys Lancaster the Wolf
 Version (far from actual release) [Thank goodness]

Premise
    So many people seem to have a problem trying to pick a fursona. They either like too many animals, or they can't think of one that "matches" their personality or fits their aesthetics or whatever. Therefore, I made this program to help them make a choice (nobody's stopping you from having two fursonas either). [But if you have two, that's twice as much money spent on coms!]

Function
    This program measures 11 aspects of personality that I find are critical to determining a proper fursona. [only 11, huh?] The top two traits are used to determine your fursona. When the maximums for traits for a certain fursona are met, you qualify as a perfect match. The program deletes itself so you can't try to force a certain outcome (after all, if you want to be an fox so bad, why don't you?). [I feel personally attacked]
    Each question has multiple responses. Different responses add to different traits.

Todos:
    - Fix balancing issues
        - Scaley and Avian representation
    - Add more questions (helps with above)
    - Fursona gender???
    - Dynamically allocate questions, no procedural code.
    - OOP babay [You ought to have programmed in Java if you cared about OOP and boilerplate.]
    - Expand the "perverse" personality trait: what does it actually mean?
        - Should I include information based on [removed] and [removed]? or make that a seperate test? [Glad I didn't find that on the drive.]
    - Flavor text for personality traits like the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon personality test [That was a good game.]
    - Adjustable speed [Yes]
