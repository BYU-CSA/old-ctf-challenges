Hello there! This is Ryan!
I've taken the liberty of patching out some of the more... inappropriate bits in the program, as well as cleaning up some of the old readme.
    All my comments can be found between square brackets [like this].

In my patching of the program, I did find a few things that might be helpful.
    - It seems as if our software engineering friend has fallen into the bad habit of using global variables for fast programming.
    - The program deletes itself when finished executing, keep a backup copy.
    - Brute forcing is nearly impossible because of the flavor text printing method, oh well.
    - The executable is staticly linked, which is great; no need for .so objects.
    - The program *does* respond to parameters. I found that adding a 'v' skips the intro text.
        - I wouldn't recommend this on your first time, it's obvious our lupine friend tried really hard to write 2nd person fiction, so try to suspend your disbelief, yeah?
