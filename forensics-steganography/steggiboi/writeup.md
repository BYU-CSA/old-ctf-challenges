 This is just a static site all about the famous steggiboi. The name hopefully hints towards steganography. To solve this challenge, one must go to the inspect element portion of their web browser, grab the favicon, download it, and look at the 2 least significant bits. I did it here: `https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload` Once you extract those bits, you will find the flag!
