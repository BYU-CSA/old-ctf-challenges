Your hunt begins in earnest now. Now that you know the username of the last person to modify your mission orders, you begin to fear the worst. What else do they know? Is your mission compromised? As you continue searching your computer, you notice a file in your Pictures folder with a recently created timestamp. Interesting. You open it, but it tells you that the file type is invalid. Whatever this is, it isn't a PNG. What is most likely the original file extension for this photo? Assume that the original extension matches the actual file type for flowers.png. Give the answer as:
byuctf{.ext} (where .ext would be .docx for a Word document, .jpg for a JPG, etc.)

Note: changing file extensions to try to obfuscate files is such a common anti-forensic/hacking technique that almost every major forensic suite has processing options to look for this. The option is in X-Ways, Magnet AXIOM, FTK, etc. (Autopsy can do it with a module). This is especially done when exfiltrating files, as it is one way to try to hide data as you pull it out of a system.
