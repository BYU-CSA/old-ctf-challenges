It has been several weeks since the hotel incident, and you were fairly confident that you had sanitized your machine. No malware to be found. You aren't so confident anymore. In your logs, you can see indication that your user - CrimsonDragon - ran SDelete on your computer. The process lists you as the creator, and all signs point to your user running the software. But you never ran SDelete. Your login screen is locked behind a key card and face recognition software, so you know that someone wasn't signed in as you during that time. They could have signed in as themselves, however, and then called a process using your username and password. What user was actually signed into the computer on 3/14/2023 around 8-9 PM? Give the answer as:

WARNING: this challenge will be difficult to do without a Windows machine. Unfortunately, digital forensics can be pretty picky that way. If you need to view the event log with Linux, I would recommend looking at some of the options here: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/btnuiz/how_do_you_view_windows_event_viewer_in_linux/
