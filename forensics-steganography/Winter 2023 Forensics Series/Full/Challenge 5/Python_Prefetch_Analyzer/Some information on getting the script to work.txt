In order to work, this script uses pyscca. I would recommend using the following:

First, install the full package (not the source code!) from the instructions here:
https://github.com/libyal/libscca/wiki/Building#getting-the-source
Again, do NOT download the GitHub source code! Make your life easier!

Then, use setup.py to install the python-binding only build.
