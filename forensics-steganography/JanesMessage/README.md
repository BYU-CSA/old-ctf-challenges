# JanesMessage

My friend found these books of Jane Austen! He said he loves them! But he doesn't seem like the Austen type.... could he maybe be sending a secret message through the image?

# WRITEUP

If you open the properties of the image in File Explorer, you will see the author content is the flag: byuctf{Jane_IS_A_DINOSAUR}
