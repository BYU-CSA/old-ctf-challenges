## Intro:
I would just give the link to the site for this challenge. 

## Solution:

This challenge just gives the link to https://mysupercoolctfsite.weebly.com/. There is a "clue" link on the site to the song "Stressed Out" by 21 pilots, which says "I wish we could turn back time"... if you to the wayback machine, and look at nov 22 at 22:47:02 the flag is on the site. in plain text
